## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Markdown-First Output Fordmt
The CLI SHALL default to well-fordmtted Markdown output optimized for LLM/agent consumption. The output SHALL:
- Use clear section headers (`##`, `###`) to organize infordmtion
- Present tabular data in Markdown tables with aligned columns
- Include contextual metadata (IDs, timestamps, counts) that agents need for follow-up actions
- Use consistent fordmtting patterns across all commands
- Provide actionable infordmtion (e.g., "Use `rdm issue get --id 123` for details")

#### Scenario: List command outputs Markdown table
- **WHEN** `rdm issue list --project myproject` is executed
- **THEN** the output is a Markdown table with columns for ID, Subject, Status, Assignee, and Updated

#### Scenario: Get command outputs structured Markdown
- **WHEN** `rdm issue get --id 123` is executed
- **THEN** the output includes a header with issue ID and subject, followed by labeled fields in a readable fordmt

#### Scenario: Success message includes context
- **WHEN** `rdm time create --issue 123 --hours 2 --activity Development` succeeds
- **THEN** the output confirms creation with the new entry's ID and key details the agent can reference

### Requirement: Output Fordmt Selection
The CLI SHALL support `--fordmt` flag with options:
- `markdown` (default): Human and agent-readable structured Markdown
- `json`: Machine-parseable JSON envelope for programmatic pipelines

#### Scenario: Default fordmt is Markdown
- **WHEN** a command is executed without `--fordmt`
- **THEN** the output is fordmtted as Markdown

#### Scenario: JSON fordmt returns envelope
- **WHEN** a command is executed with `--fordmt json`
- **THEN** the output is a JSON object with `ok`, `data`, `meta`, and `error` fields

### Requirement: JSON Output Envelope
When `--fordmt json` is specified, the CLI SHALL return responses in a consistent JSON envelope fordmt containing:
- `ok`: boolean indicating success/failure
- `data`: the response payload (object, array, or null)
- `meta`: metadata object (pagination info, timestamps)
- `error`: error details object (null on success)

#### Scenario: Successful JSON command returns envelope with data
- **WHEN** a command executes successfully with `--fordmt json`
- **THEN** the response has `ok: true`, populated `data`, and `error: null`

#### Scenario: Failed JSON command returns envelope with error
- **WHEN** a command fails with `--fordmt json`
- **THEN** the response has `ok: false`, `data: null`, and populated `error` with code and message

### Requirement: Error Output for Agents
Error messages SHALL be fordmtted to help agents understand and recover:
- Clear error type/code at the start
- Concise description of what went wrong
- Suggestion for resolution when applicable
- In Markdown mode: fordmtted as a blockquote or admonition
- In JSON mode: structured error object with code, message, and details

#### Scenario: Validation error suggests fix
- **WHEN** `rdm time create --hours -1` is executed (invalid hours)
- **THEN** the error explains that hours must be positive and shows correct usage

#### Scenario: Not found error includes ID
- **WHEN** `rdm issue get --id 99999` is executed for non-existent issue
- **THEN** the error clearly states "Issue #99999 not found"

### Requirement: Exit Code Contract
The CLI SHALL return standardized exit codes:
- 0: Success
- 2: Validation/argument errors
- 3: Authentication/configuration errors
- 4: Resource not found
- 5: API/server/network errors

#### Scenario: Successful execution returns exit code 0
- **WHEN** a command completes successfully
- **THEN** the process exits with code 0

#### Scenario: Invalid arguments return exit code 2
- **WHEN** required arguments are missing or invalid
- **THEN** the process exits with code 2

#### Scenario: Missing credentials return exit code 3
- **WHEN** API key or URL is not configured
- **THEN** the process exits with code 3

### Requirement: Non-Interactive Default
The CLI SHALL NOT prompt for input unless the `--interactive` flag is provided.

#### Scenario: Missing required argument fails without prompt
- **WHEN** a required argument is missing and `--interactive` is not set
- **THEN** the CLI returns an error without prompting

### Requirement: Configuration Precedence
The CLI SHALL load configuration in this order (first wins):
1. CLI flags (`--url`, `--api-key`)
2. Environment variables (`REDMINE_URL`, `REDMINE_API_KEY`)
3. Active profile from config file
4. Error if credentials not found

#### Scenario: CLI flags override environment variables
- **WHEN** both `--url` flag and `REDMINE_URL` env var are set
- **THEN** the CLI uses the value from the flag

#### Scenario: Environment variables override config file
- **WHEN** `REDMINE_URL` env var is set and config file has different URL
- **THEN** the CLI uses the value from the environment variable

### Requirement: Profile Management
The CLI SHALL support multiple named profiles stored in a config file with commands:
- `profile add --name <name> --url <url> --api-key <key>`
- `profile use <name>` - set active profile
- `profile list` - list all profiles
- `profile delete --name <name>`
- `config show` - display current configuration (redacting API key)

#### Scenario: Adding a new profile
- **WHEN** `rdm profile add --name work --url https://redmine.example.com --api-key xxx` is executed
- **THEN** a new profile named "work" is saved to the config file

#### Scenario: Switching active profile
- **WHEN** `rdm profile use work` is executed
- **THEN** the "work" profile becomes the active profile for subsequent commands

### Requirement: Diagnostic Commands
The CLI SHALL provide diagnostic commands:
- `ping`: Verify connectivity and authentication
- `me`: Return the authenticated user's infordmtion

#### Scenario: Ping with valid credentials
- **WHEN** `rdm ping` is executed with valid credentials

#### Scenario: Me returns current user
- **WHEN** `rdm me` is executed
- **THEN** the response contains the authenticated user's id, login, and name

#### Scenario: Get project by identifier
- **WHEN** `rdm project get --identifier my-project` is executed
- **THEN** the response contains the project details in structured Markdown

### Requirement: Issue Commands
The CLI SHALL provide issue commands:
- `issue list` with filters: `--project`, `--status`, `--assigned-to`, `--author`, `--limit`, `--offset`

- **THEN** the issue is updated and the response confirms the changes

### Requirement: Time Entry Activity Caching
The CLI SHALL cache time entry activities to disk with a 24-hour TTL. The `time activities list` command refreshes the cache.

#### Scenario: Activities cached on first fetch
- **WHEN** `rdm time activities list` is executed and no cache exists
- **THEN** activities are fetched from API and saved to cache

#### Scenario: Activities served from cache within TTL

- **THEN** the time entry is deleted and success is confirmed with entry ID

### Requirement: Debug and Dry-Run Modes
The CLI SHALL support:
- `--debug`: Write request/response metadata to stderr
- `--dry-run`: Print the HTTP request without executing it

#### Scenario: Debug mode logs to stderr
- **WHEN** any command is executed with `--debug`
- **THEN** HTTP request and response details are written to stderr

#### Scenario: Dry-run shows request without executing
- **WHEN** `rdm time create --issue 123 --hours 1 --activity Dev --dry-run` is executed
